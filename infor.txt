To help you get a sense of how vague and complex a term “the metaverse” can be, here's an exercise: 
Mentally replace the phrase “the metaverse” in a sentence with “cyberspace.” Ninety percent of the time, the meaning won't substantially change.
 That's because the term doesn't really refer to any one specific type of technology, but rather a broad (and often speculative) shift in how we interact with technology.
 And it's entirely possible that the term itself will eventually become just as antiquated, even as the specific technology it once described becomes commonplace.
